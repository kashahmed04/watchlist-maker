
// Now that we have these tools installed, we need to configure webpack to work
// properly with babel. Go to webpack.config.js in the root folder of the project. Update it
// to include the following module entry.

// This entry tells webpack to use the babel-loader module to handle all js and jsx files
// being run through it (except any in the node_modules folder). Babel-loader will ensure
// our code gets run through the babel transpiler. 
// this is used so we can convert our react code into browser readable code with babel 
// use ES6 for the browser to render the code and display the data based on ES6**
// why did we need babel here and in the babel file (is it because this does the actual conversion
// into ES6 for the browser and the one in the babel file is used to say we are using react 
// with babel to convert into ES6)**
const path = require('path');

// Ideally, we want our client code to be broken up into two pieces:
// a “login bundle” which contains all the
// code needed to handle logging in and signing up, as well as an “app bundle” which
// contains all the code related to making domos.

// By defining multiple entry points, webpack will create multiple bundles. For the output
// filename, we use “[name]Bundle.js”. Webpack will pull in the name from the key in the
// entry object, so we will generate appBundle.js and loginBundle.js.
// do we use this to display the data or is it to link the JSX files to the 
// .handlebars page so we can use the specific elements in those files
// to display the data**
// we have two entry points right the app and the login**
// we say the name of the handlebars file then
// the JSX file we want to conenct it with right**
// can we do this on our project too with having a handlebars file**
